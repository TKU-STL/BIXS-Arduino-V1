## Introduction to BIXS - V1
BIXS Computer is a next generation computer system for the avionics system used in Space Technology Lab at Tamkang University. With multi-modules integration and Arduino platform, we fully utilize the power of the computer system to provide the best performance for the avionics system. Also, this software is fully modular with header file and subfunctions. Besides, our software is designed with most important elements in mind, reliablity and stability.
